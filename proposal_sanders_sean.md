## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To successfully complete this project, I will need to enhance my skills in game development using whichever game engine I choose (please help me choose Prof Rosen :)) im assuming lots of scripting interactive elements and managment of game assets. I will also be doing lots of research in effective puzzle design and narrative intergration with an interative based game. Addionally understanding the fundamentals of user experience design to make the game engaging and fun.
